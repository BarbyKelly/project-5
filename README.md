# Bugs

## Fixed Bugs

- When developer clicked on any of Art or Photos nav-links, 0 items were displayed on all occasions, and NavLinks did not change color, 
  therefore it was hard to know which tab was open. Screenshot of when Developer expected to see 'All Art' displayed, 
  instead displayed were '0 products, with a heading 'All items':

    ![0 products displayed](docs/readme_images/0_products_displayed.png)

  Developer took these steps to fix main-nav links:

  1. Developer realised, in templates/main-nav.html, she had set up different categories for Art and Photos, than categories in categories.json or Django categories:

    ![main-nav categories](docs/readme_images/main-nav categories for art and photos.png)

    ![Django categories](docs/readme_images/django categories.png)

  therefore, Art and Photos categories couldn't display, under Art and Photos NavLinks

  2. Developer matched categories in main-nav with Django categories and categories.json

  3. Art and Photos displayed now correctly, except for Beach Photos.
  None of the 'Beach Photos' were displayed. Developer noticed 'beach-photos' instead of expected: 'beach_photos' in Django Categories:

    ![beach-photo instead of beach_photo](docs/readme_images/beach-photo instead of beach_photo.png)

  Developer fixed the category name from 'beach-photo' to 'beach_photo', then Beach Photos were displayed on the website as expected:

    ![beach photos displayed ok](docs/readme_images/beach_photos_displayed_ok_opt_50.png)

  4. Developer removed 'photo' from selection of photo titles to make wording look better on the screen (previously: 'Beach photo' title displayed for one photo, and 'Beach photo' displayed for more than one photo, instead of 'Beach Photos')

  5. Developer updated all of the new names/titles for Art and Photos in main-nav.html, categories.json, and Django Categories. 

  6. 'Sky' photos didn't display under 'All Photos'. Developer checked main-nav.html, and noticed sky_photos and animal_photos were still displayed in category, for 'All Photos'. Developer changed sky_photos for sky, and animal_photos for animal, and 'Sky' photos were displayed under 'All Photos' then.

### Fixed "django.core.serializers.base.DeserializationError: Problem installing fixture"

- Developer ran command: 'python manage.py loaddata categories' and "django.core.serializers.base.DeserializationError: Problem installing fixture..." appeared in the terminal.

- Earlier that day, tutor Oisin guided developer how to fix 'keyword: title' error, relating to json files

- Developer was able to follow similar steps to figure out the error:

- Developer broke down terminal error messages into 3 main (puzzle) pieces, to understand where was the error located:

#### Keyerror: author:

  ![keyerror: author](docs/readme_images/keyerror author.png)

#### No field_name author:

  ![no field_name author](docs/readme_images/no field_name author.png)

#### Fixtures categories.json:

  ![fixtures categories.json](docs/readme_images/fixtures categories.json.png)

- Developer had been focusing on field 'author' in categories.json file. Seeing 'author' is in categories.json file, so why would it come up as an error, 'no field_name author'

- After looking at these 3 parts of terminal messages, and checking out fields in Django for Adding 'Categories':

#### Django Add Categories:

  ![Django Add Categories](docs/readme_images/django admin categories.png)

developer realised issue was that categories.json had a field 'author', while in admin.py/Django categories there was no 'author' field set up

- Developer removed 'author' field from categories.json and 'python manage.py loaddata categories' command worked then ok:

  ![load categories command worked](docs/readme_images/load categories command worked.png)

- Fixing this bug/error was a great lesson for the developer, she learned how to better understand Terminal messages, and saw more value in them

- This error/bug also helped Developer to realize, she had added products to Django and hadn't updated categories.json accordingly, to reflect
changes made via Django Products.



- Product amounts were not updating in the basket: 
developer adjusted <div class="input-group-prepend"> and <div class="input-group-append"> in cart.html. 

Developer was able to update the amount of certain products in the cart, yet couldn't increase or decrease products when putting it into cart:

  ![Increase/decrease buttons not working](docs/readme_images/buttons_clicking_but_quantity_remains_the_same_opt.png)

Button still didn't work, after adusting cart.html, or quantity_input_script.html:

  ![Fixed var plusDisabled](docs/readme_images/fix var plusDisabled.png)

Arrows up and down in Quantity box, worked ok, and increased or decreased Quantity as needed, and Subtotal accordingly.



 
- nothing in the cart when clicking on add to cart

- cart shows â‚¬0.00 on the website, but when you click to open the cart, it has items in

- Plus and minus buttons would not work, when developer tried to adjust item quantities in the cart. 
  Developer could only increase the item quantities with arrows:

  ![Plus and minus buttons not working](docs/readme_images/bug_plus_minus_opt_50.png)

  Developer thought issue is in base.html, scripts must be not correct. As plus and minus buttons had worked when she followed Boutique Ado walk-through for her walk-through project.
  Developer used [Diffchecker](https://www.diffchecker.com/) to compare her project 5's code vs Boutique Ado walk-through lesson,
  and then compared the script codes vs the Boutique Ado version that had worked for the developer:

  ![Comparing codes with Diffchecker](docs/readme_images/bug_fix_plus_minus.png)

  Developer went back to lesson "Base Template Part 1":

  ![Base template changes](docs/readme_images/walk_through_instructions.png)

  to see where she may have made an error. Developer found that she had used the updated code when she created her walk-through project, but had used different version of code for project 5.

  Developer adjusted block corejs code in her project 5, to match the one that worked for her walk-through project. This fixed the error. Plus and minus buttons were fixed, developer was able to increase or decrease the number of particular item in the cart with plus and minus buttons:

  ![Plus and minus buttons work](docs/readme_images/plus_minus_work_opt_50.png)

  - Developer noticed how "All Photos" and "All Art", showed 0 items, while "All Items" displayed all items. She couldn't find 
    what was causing the error. Developer's coursemate Patrick Hladun found an error: two of the product categories had the same "pk":9 
  ![pk error](docs/readme_images/pk_error.png)

    Developer fixed conflict between pk numbers, and used ![jsonformatter.com](https://jsonformatter.org/) to help her to fix rest of categories.json, as "author": "author" was missing under pk:1, and pk:6 "author": "author" was missing one of these: '}':
    
    ![error line 1](docs/readme_images/error_line1.png)
    
    After fixing these errors, json file validation worked as expected:

  ![JSON working ok](docs/readme_images/fixed_pk.png)


- Developer noticed Logo had 'Art', while NavLinks had 'Drawings'. Developer replaced 'Drawing' with 'Art' in fixtures: categories.json, in django categories, and in index.html (Home page), and in main.nav html (templates), and then 'Art' was displayed instead of 'Drawings':

  ![Before: NavLink 'Drawings' instead of Art](<docs/readme_images/bug, art vs drawings.png>)


  ![After: NavLink 'Art'](<docs/readme_images/word drawings replaced with art.png>)

## Logo

- As Kelly's Photo & Art Boutique displays Art made by the developer's kids, the developer asked her kids to come up with a logo. 
Website's Logo was designed by developer's 10 year old daughter Aoife. With developer's guidance, Aoife used Balsamiq Wireframes to create the Logo by herself. Aoife chose colors based on Developer's wish for 'cornflower blue'.
Developer used ![Color contrast check](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/9fc5f8-134f5c) to check and slightly adjust contrast of colors. And together, developer and Aoife chose icons for Logo. Developer adjusted the layout of the Title on the Logo. Developer's 6 year old daughter Ciara watched every step, and gave her approval.
Logo has Aoife's art work, Ciara's art work, and photo by the developer. 
Website's finalised logo:
