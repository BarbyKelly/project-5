- Drawings and Photos have same words, for searching specific items, need to ensure unique names?

# Acknowledgements

- Developer is grateful for any guidance and support provided by her family and friends, mentor, facilitator, tutors, Slack members, and online content creators.

- Developer understands the importance of hiding Secret Keys. Mentor Lauren-Nicole Popich suggested to mention in README, that secret key was visible at the start of the project, as the developer was following the steps from Boutique Ado walk-through. Developer changed the key and hid it, as advised by her mentor.
