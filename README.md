## Bugs

- Products would not display. Nothing happened when the developer clicked on All Items to see the products.

- Drawings and Photos have same words, for searching specific items, need to ensure unique names?

- When clicking on "Drawings: by price, by author or All drawings, by price, by author, All Photos or latest drawings, latest photos or All Latest", 
  nothing is displayed. Only "All Items"link works.

- nothing in the cart when clicking on add to cart

- cart shows â‚¬0.00 on the website, but when you click to open the cart, it has items in

- Plus and minus buttons would not work, when developer tried to adjust item quantities in the cart. 
  Developer could only increase the item quantities with arrows:

  ![Plus and minus buttons not working](bugplusminus.png)

  Developer thought issue is in base.html, scripts must be not correct. As plus and minus buttons had worked when she followed Boutique Ado walk-through for her walk-through project.
  Developer used [Diffchecker](https://www.diffchecker.com/) to compare her project 5's code vs Boutique Ado walk-through lesson,
  and then compared the script codes vs the Boutique Ado version that had worked for the developer:

  ![Comparing codes with Diffchecker](bug_fix_plus_minus.png)

  Developer went back to lesson "Base Template Part 1":

  ![Base template changes](walk_through_instructions.png)

  to see where she may have made an error. Developer found that she had used the updated code when she created her walk-through project, but had used different version of code for project 5.

  Developer adjusted block corejs code in her project 5, to match the one that worked for her walk-through project. This fixed the error. Plus and minus buttons were fixed, developer was able to increase or decrease the number of particular item in the cart with plus and minus buttons:

  ![Plus and minus buttons work](plus_minus_work.png)

  - Developer noticed how "All Photos" and "All Drawings", showed 0 items, while "All Items" displayed all items. She couldn't find 
    what was causing the error. Developer's coursemate Patrick Hladun found an error: two of the product categories had the same "pk":9 
  ![pk error](pk_error.png)

    Developer fixed conflict between pk numbers, and used ![jsonformatter.com](https://jsonformatter.org/) to help her to fix rest of categories.json, as "author": "author" was missing under pk:1, and pk:6 "author": "author" was missing one of these: '}':
    
    ![error line 1](error_line1.png)
    
    After fixing these errors, json file validation worked as expected:

  ![JSON working ok](fixed_pk.png)

  All Photos and All Drawings still showing 0 products

# References & Credits

- All of the code for Kelly's Art & Photo Boutique is based on Code Institute's Walk-through project ["Boutique Ado"](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/boutique_ado_v1) 
  The developer has credited Walk-through mainly on top of html files, 
  due to enourmous number of other files, which are all coded like Walk-through project.

- General ReadMe template derived from developer's Project 4 [Blog](), that README was originally based on: [findMEreadME](https://github.com/brodsa/findMEreadME/blob/main/README.md#content)

- Search icon from: [fontawesome.com](https://fontawesome.com/v4/icon/search)

- As Kelly's Photo & Art Boutique sells drawings made by the developer's kids, the developer asked her kids to come up with a logo. 
  Website's Logo was designed by developer's 10 year old daughter Aoife. With developer's guidance, Aoife used Balsamiq Wireframes to create the Logo by herself. Aoife chose colors based on Developer's wish for 'cornflower blue'.
  Developer used ![Color contrast check](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/9fc5f8-134f5c) to check and slightly adjust contrast of colors. And together, developer and Aoife chose icons for Logo. Developer adjusted the layout of the Title on the Logo. Developer's 6 year old daughter Ciara watched every step, and gave her approval. Website's finalised logo:

- Developer chose "Cart-arrow-down" icon from [Font Awesome](<i class="fa-solid fa-cart-arrow-down"></i>) to hightlight there's only 
  an option to download items from Kelly's Art & Photo Boutique, no physical items sold

# Acknowledgements

- Developer is grateful for any guidance and support provided by her family and friends, mentor, facilitator, tutors, Slack members, 
  Coursemate Patrick Hladun, and online content creators.

- Special thank you to developer's daughters Aoife and Ciara, for allowing their beautiful art to be part of this e-commerce       
  website, and for creating a unique Logo

- Developer understands the importance of hiding Secret Keys. Mentor Lauren-Nicole Popich suggested to mention in README, that  
  secret key was visible at the start of the project, as the developer was following the steps from Boutique Ado walk-through. Developer changed the key and hid it, as advised by her mentor.
